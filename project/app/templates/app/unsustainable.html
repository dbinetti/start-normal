<h2>
  The Four Pillars Can't Sustain Weight
</h2>
<p>
All told, there are four main components to the framework, marketed as the “Four Pillars”: Hygiene, Masks, Distance and Gatherings.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Hygenie</strong> is mostly about washing hands and cleaning facilities and aside from some irritated skin from too much hand sanitizer is largely a reasonable assumption.  They mandate daily temperature checks on children which is likely to create some privacy concerns, but hygiene is at least doable.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Masks</strong> are more problematic.  They are expected to be worn at all times by all staff, visitors, and students from K through 12.  The framework cites an extensive review by an international consortium of scientists which found that well-fitting masks reduce transmissibility, which is true.  But the key assumption is “well-fitting”, which means that the wearers have to put them on properly and keep them on at all times.  This is a plausible assumption for high school, and perhaps upper middle.  But at elementary school and below this is wholly unrealistic.  And how do you teach phonics wearing a mask?  Will parents accept illiteracy as the price of "safety"?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Distance</strong> is the requirement that students and staff stay six feet apart at all times, and is far and away the most unrealistic assumption.  Due to classroom size constraints, the framework mandates a staggered schedule where half the students receive in-person instruction and half distance-learning, but that assumes teachers do both in-person and distance learning simultaneously.  Now our teachers are miracle workers in many ways, but doing two jobs at the same time is a mathematical impossibility — and that is before the budget cuts.  I could continue to provide dozens of examples where distance assumption fails against reality, but the fact the framework doesn’t address this very obvious issue with teachers is a little troubling.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gatherings</strong> prohibits all ‘non-required’ activities, including drama, music, sports, assemblies, libraries, cafeterias and physical education (aside from solitary activities).  This assumes that these are ‘non-required’, with which many parents and child development professionals disagree.
</p>
<p>
   In summary, three of these four pillars are flimsily constructed and won’t hold our children’s weight.  And when all this comes crashing down everyone will suffer.
