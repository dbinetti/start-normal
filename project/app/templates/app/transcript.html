    <p>My name is David Binetti, I grew up here in San Mateo County and now live in San Carlos with my wife and two daughters. And like you, I’m concerned about how they’re going to be reopening the schools in the fall. Now I asked for a copy of the plan but was told parents weren’t allowed to see that, but I still managed to get a hold of the document I’m not supposed to see, and this is their plan for reopening the schools. </p>

    <p>It’s mostly 50+ pages of jargon and that’s to be expected, but there’s one critical thing parents need to know, and that’s the organizing principle. It coems from Dr. Scott Morrow, the Public Health Officer for San Mateo County, who basically is the driving force behind the document. And he says, </p>

    <p class='quote'>“The balance here is the development needs of children, who may have lifelong adverse ramifications if these needs are not met, and the risk of transmission to high risk family members, which may or may not result in serious illness or death.”</p>

    <p>More plainly: it’s children v. adults. </p>

    <p>So let's go over some details.  He deems libraries, music, athletics, art, drama and extra curricular activities as “Not Required”, so that's gone. Masks must be worn all day, by all students and staff, from the moment you step on campus until you leave, starting in kindergarten.  Now I don't know how you teach phonics with a mask on, but that's not in this docuemtn?  And the distance requirements mean students will be on campus half the time, and distance learning from home half the time.  But how you have teachers do two jobs at the same time, as you cut the budget?  That's not in here.</p>

    <p>I could go on, but the bottom line is there’s nothing balanced about this document. Dr. Morrow has decided the children must suffer those lifelong adverse ramifications: educationally, physically, mentally, socially, emotionally. And they must do so for <em>years</em>, until a vaccine is developed.   It’s bad. </p>

    <p>But what makes it even worse is that it’s a <strong>false choice</strong>. </p>

    <p>When the pandemic started we were all afraid, and blunt policy choices were warranted. But since then we’ve learned so much about Covid-19. For instance, we now know:</p>


      <p>Serious illness in children is extremely rare.  The CDC has it at two in a million.<br>
      Spread from children to adults is extremely rare.  Studies haven't found a single confirmed case of child to adult transmission anywhere in the world.<br>
      Long Term Care Facilities are where the damage is done.  In San Mateo County 65% of the deaths have been in the nursing homes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If we created a targeted, age-based policy we can address the needs of both adults and children without being forced to choose between them.</p>

    <p>But that means trusting the data over our fears, and that is particularly difficult when Dr. Morrow continues to claim that catastrophe is imminent. But the county has seen just 84 deaths, and while each is tragic that is no justification to set back 100,000 school children public and private that still have their whole lives ahead of them. </p>

    <p>Parents are taking action against this, and we’re starting with a letter to the Board of Supervisors that rejects the false choice that will hurt our kids. More action is planned and we’ll keep you updated, but the place to start is by signing this letter and sharing it with every parent you know.</p>

    <p>Because our kids will never be normal until we Start Normal. </p>

    Here is <a href='{%url "letter" %}'>the letter</a>.
