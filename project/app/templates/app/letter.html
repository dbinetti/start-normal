  <h4>Supervisors,</h4>
  <p>
    We, the undersigned parents, are gravely concerned that, as drafted, the reopening schools framework will not allow for in-person instruction.  The document purports to balance the potentially "lifelong adverse ramifications" to child development against the need to protect high-risk adults from community spread, yet there are no data provided to back up the conclusions reached.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have repeatedly reached out to the primary driver of the document, San Mateo County Public Health Officer Dr. Scott Morrow, to no avail.  Multiple attempts made in good faith, both directly and indirectly -- including through a
    personal appeal from a Supervisor -- have been ignored.  This dismissive behavior only heightens our concern, since his decisions take away the power of our local school boards whom we elected to represent our children's interests.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe Dr. Morrow should broaden his considerations to include the impact on social-emotional learning, two working-parent families, and the adverse mental health and despair deaths when considering the impact on high-risk adults.  Most of all, if Dr. Morrow is to invoke "science" in support of the framework, he must employ the basis on which hypothesis are evaluated: evidence.

    The burden is on the Public Health Officer to support his decision and persuade parents that the tradeoffs he made were in the best interest of the community at large.
