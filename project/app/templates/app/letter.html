<h2>
  San Mateo County Board of Supervisors,
</h2>
  <p>
    We, the undersigned parents, believe that your appointed Public Health Officer for San Mateo County, Dr. Scott Morrow, is presenting you with a false choice between children and adults.  His restrictions on the schools will set back the education of 100,000 schoolchildren in San Mateo County, both public and private, in an overly broad and inequitable manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    We insist that Dr. Morrow implement an age-stratified policy that reflects the latest evidence in the fight against Covid-19 which show both illness and spread in children is extremely rare.  However, at the very least, Dr. Morrow owes every parent in the County to provide actual evidence &mdash; not simply mathematical models or counterfactuals &mdash; that justify aggressive actions that are expected to remain in place for years and will impact every aspect of San Mateo County.
