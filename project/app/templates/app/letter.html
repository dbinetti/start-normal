<h2>
  Mike Callagy<br>
  San Mateo County Executive
<br><br><br>
  Dear Mr. Callagy,
</h2>

  <p>
    We are writing to request you direct San Mateo County Public Health Officer, Dr. Scott Morrow, to
    engage with parents.  We have repeatedly reached out to Dr. Morrow in good faith, including through a
    personal appeal from Board of Supervisors President Warren Slocum, only to be ignored.  Hence, we
    are reaching out to you as his superior officer to please direct him to respond.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe Dr. Morrow should broaden his considerations to include the social-emotional impact his
    choices will have on our children and provide evidence that his proposed solutions effectively address the problem he seeks to solve.  We are only asking for an opportunity to present our concerns and receive a data-driven response.
  </p>
  <p>
    If Dr. Morrow is unwilling or unable to address these concerns, we respectfully submit he
  should allow the Districts through their elected School Boards to be able to determined what is in the best interest of their children.  </p>

  <p>
    Respectfully,
    Parents of San Mateo County Schoolchildren
  </p>
<p>
