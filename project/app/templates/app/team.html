    Sorry, not much of a team.  This isn't a big company, it's just me.  My name is <a href='http://www.dbinetti.com/'>David Binetti</a>, I'm a dad, and I started this effort because I'm worried about my kids and community.  I volunteer as a crossing guard, help manage the PTA website, donate thousands to our local educational foundation, and attend school board meetings regularly.

  <p>
    <strong>I am not political</strong>.  I'm a registered independent and I've only donated to one politician in my life: former San Mateo County Supervisor <a href='https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?n=mary-griffin-ramseur&pid=181058529&fhid=2353'>Mary Griffin</a>, and the only reason I did that was because she was my kindergarten teacher at <a href='https://skyline-ssfusd-ca.schoolloop.com'>Skyline Elementary</a> in Daly City.
  </p>

  <p>
    Iâ€™m an entrepreneur who founded companies to help people get easy access to information.  I worked on the first version of <a href='https://www.quicken.com'>Quicken.com</a>, started <a href='https://www.USA.gov'>USA.gov</a>, and my last company was eventually <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaJ3MuazAZ8&t=1s'>acquired by Pinterest</a>.  These days I help Fortune 500 companies avoid billion-dollar disasters when faced with <a href='https://www.theleanstartup.com'>high uncertainty</a> through a financial pricing model I developed called <a href='https://www.innovation-options.com'>innovation options</a>.

    If you want to reach me just email me at <a href='mailto:dbinetti@startnormal.com'>dbinetti@startnormal.com</a> and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
