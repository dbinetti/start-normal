    <h4>
      How does this work?
    </h4>
    <p class='mb-5 mt-3'>
      It's fairly simple, actually; we're just collecting information from parents who want in-person education, form them together into cohorts of kids from the same school and grade, and connect them together.  Then, when a particular group reaches five students, we find a teacher so they can begin working out plans for how and when instruction can begin in August.
    </p>
    <h4>
      How much does it cost?
    </h4>
    <p class='mb-5 mt-3'>
      It's free to register.  Each teacher sets his/her own rate, and varies depending on the length of commitment, number of students, etc,.  That said, a typical engagement of five students would be $150 an hour, which split five ways is $30/hour per student.  Assuming three hours of instruction per day, that's roughly $500 per week.  Again, each group is free to work this out for themselves.
    </p>
    <h4>
      What about masks, distance, etc.?
    </h4>
    <p class='mb-5 mt-3'>
      We believe adults can make adult decisions based on the available science and evidence.  Each cohort is free to set their own parameters for safety, including masks, distancing, hygienic practices, etc.  That said, this is a program designed for low-risk groups (ie, generally young and healthy.)  Teachers with high-risk conditions, or students with family members at elevated risk, etc., probably shouldn't participate.
    </p>
    <h4>
      I just want you to find me a tutor.  Can you do that?
    </h4>
    <p class='mb-5 mt-3'>
      Sorry, that isn't the point of this site.  This is about teaching, not tutoring.  Each parent is obviously free to find their own educational resources for 1:1 instruction; we want to help foster not only academic learning but social-emotional learning as well, and that only comes from face-to-face group instruction.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Is this safe?
    </h4>
    <p class='mb-5 mt-3'>
      Schools in Europe have been operating safely for months.  Denmark in particular has fully opened all schools for all ages &mdash; more than a million students since April &mdash; with no masks, no distance requirements, and has seen no teacher infections and no student-to-student infection as of June.  The same is true in Norway, Finland, and Sweden.  We don't know much about Covid-19, but we do know that serious illness in children from the disease is virtually non-existent, and child to adult transmission is extremely rare.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Does this work with Distance Learning?
    </h4>
    <p class='mb-5 mt-3'>
      Absolutely.  You could do this in addition to Distance Learning, or have the teacher use the Distance Learning material, or just teach the Distance Learning material yourselves with in-person, at-home, small-group instruction.  Or it could be a complete replacement to Distance Learning.  Again, it's up to each group to decide for themselves.
    </p>
    <h4>
      What is taught?
    </h4>
    <p class='mb-5 mt-3'>
      The groups themselves can determine their curriculum along with the instructor.  However, we almost certainly will start with the basics:  reading, writing, arithmetic, and social studies.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Where will they take place?
    </h4>
    <p class='mb-5 mt-3'>
      Each group will be free to set their own schedule and venue.  However, we generally expect that instruction will take place at the home of a participating parent.
    </p>
    <h4>
      What kind of screening or vetting do you do?
    </h4>
    <p class='mb-5 mt-3'>
      The groups will have an opportunity to do their own interviews and assessments of instructors, and instructors of students.  These are voluntary associations, and they will only make sense if each participant is comfortable with the teacher/student interaction.
    </p>
    <h4>
      What is expected of parents?
    </h4>
    <p class='mb-5 mt-3'>
      While this will be less of an imposition than distance learning, it will be more than just sending your kids to school.  Parents will need to serve as hosts if their location allows it, and others will need to participate such that students and teachers are always monitored by other adults.  This should not be considered child-care or a "drop and dash" scenario.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Are you doing this now?
    </h4>
    <p class='mb-5 mt-3'>
      Our family has been doing this throughout the summer and it has worked wonderfully.  Our kids have fully caught up from the spring and are back on track.  Most important, they have rekindled that love of learning that was totally absent from screen-based instruction.
    </p>
    <h4>
      What if I have more questions?
    </h4>
    <p class='mb-5 mt-3'>
      I'm sure you will!  Much of this will need to be figured out as we go along.  But if you have questions or ideas then please feel free to let me know by calling/texting me at 415.713.2126 or by email at <a href='mailto:dbinetti@startnormal.com'>dbinetti@startnormal.com</a>.
