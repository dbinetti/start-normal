My name is David Binetti and I started this effort because I'm worried about my kids and community.  I’m an <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaJ3MuazAZ8&t=1s'>entrepreneur</a> who founded companies to help people get easy access to information.  I created <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA.gov'>USA.gov</a> which won the Harvard’s <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA.gov'>Innovations in American Government</a> award and was named <a href='https://www.usatoday.com'>USA Today</a>’s Site of the Year way back in 2000.  And I’m a registered independent.  My focus is on my two daughters, in second and fifth grade, not politics.

These days I help Fortune 500 companies avoid billion-dollar disasters when faced with high uncertainty.  I do this with one simple <a href='http://www.dbinetti.com/#options'>approach</a>: I get them to test their assumptions before they commit to projects.  It seems like such a small, obvious thing, but you’d be amazed how often brilliant, powerful people make tremendously costly mistakes simply because they don’t bother to check something before they act.

  And sadly, that's exactly what's happening with the school reopening proposal.  I'm afraid that if we don't stop it, our children, district and cities will suffer irrepreable damage.
