  My name is <a href='http://www.dbinetti.com/'>David Binetti</a>, I'm a dad, and I started this effort because I'm worried about my kids and community.  I volunteer as a crossing guard, help manage the PTA website, donate thousands to our local educational foundation, and attend school board meetings regularly.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>I am not political</strong>.  I'm a registered independent and I've only donated to one politician in my life: former San Mateo County Supervisor <a href='https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?n=mary-griffin-ramseur&pid=181058529&fhid=2353'>Mary Griffin</a>, and the only reason I did that was because she was my kindergarten teacher at <a href='https://skyline-ssfusd-ca.schoolloop.com'>Skyline Elementary</a> in Daly City.  You won't find me on social media because I quit Facebook in 2014.
</p>

<p>
  I’m an <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaJ3MuazAZ8&t=1s'>entrepreneur</a> who founded companies to help people get easy access to information.  These days I help Fortune 500 companies avoid billion-dollar disasters when faced with high uncertainty.  I do this with one simple <a href='http://www.dbinetti.com/#options'>approach</a>: I get them to test their assumptions before they commit to projects.  It seems like such a small, obvious thing, but you’d be amazed how often brilliant, powerful people make tremendously costly mistakes simply because they don’t check their data.
</p>
<p>
  And that's what I'm seeing happening now with the schools, so I decided to do something about it.
