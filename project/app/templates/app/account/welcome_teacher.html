  <p class='lead'>
    Thank you for considering teaching under Start Normal!
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently working on the right questions to ask here, and so there isn't much to do beyond simply registering you as a potential teacher.
  </p>
  <p>
    However I am hard at work on this and would <strong>LOVE</strong> to hear from you on what you think the right questions are to ask here.  Feel free to just call/text me at 415.713.2126 or send me an email at <a href='mailto:dbinetti@startnormal.com'>dbinetti@startnormal.com</a>.
