      <p class='card-text'>
        We, the undersigned parents, are gravely concerned that, as drafted, the reopening schools framework does not strike the proper balance between the potentially "lifelong adverse ramifications" to child development and the need to protect high-risk adults from community spread.  This is made more troubling by the lack of data supporting its conclusions.
      </p>
      <p class='card-text'>
        We have repeatedly reached out to the primary driver of the document, San Mateo County Public Health Officer Dr. Scott Morrow, to no avail.  Multiple attempts made in good faith, both directly and indirectly -- including through a personal appeal from a Supervisor -- have been ignored.  This dismissive behavior only heightens our concern, since his decisions take away the power of our local school boards whom we elected to represent our children's interests.
      </p>
      <p class='card-text'>
        We believe Dr. Morrow should broaden his considerations to include the impact on social-emotional learning, working-parent families, and general welfare of students and teachers when considering the impact to high-risk adults who are largely isolated from the schools.  Most of all, if Dr. Morrow is to invoke "science" in support of the framework, he must employ the basis on which hypothesis are evaluated: evidence.
      </p>
      <p class='card-text'>
        The burden is on the Public Health Officer to support his decision and explain to parents that the tradeoffs he made were in the best interest of the community at large.
