        Friends, this will be a brief but important update.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the school year started in earnest and most plans now firmly in place, it’s clear that there is no longer a reason for Start Normal to continue.  Thus, I’ll be shutting down the service, effective immediately.

        As I said from the beginning, when the project was over I was going to delete all information including names, email addresses, mailing list subscriptions, and any other data.  This will happen automatically; no action on your part is required.  If you wish to reach me in the future, feel free to email dbinetti@gmail.com, or phone at 415.713.2126.

      <p>
        Some of you have been with us from the beginning, others have joined since our switch to pod-learning.  You are all appreciated.  We accomplished much despite significant opposition, and that is something of which to be very proud.  Again, my deepest thanks, and I encourage you all to keep advocating for in-person education for our kids.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best, <br>
        Dave
