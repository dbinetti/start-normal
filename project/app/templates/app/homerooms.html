      Set Up Homeroom Pod
    </p>
    <p>
      A Homeroom is a stable pod of students to be taught as a group.  Typical homerooms are about 4-6 students of the same grade with similar preferences for schedule, frequency and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've set up starting Homerooms for your students; you can keep the ones we've created and invite students to them, or you can search for an already established Homeroom that matches your needs (including merging the Homerooms of your students into one.)
