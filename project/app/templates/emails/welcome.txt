Thanks for joining our group of parents and teachers seeking
in-person, at-home, small-group instruction for our children.

I'm sorry this welcome message is a bit late in reaching you;
I wasn't actually ready to launch the site formally, but I am very
glad that you were able to sign up a bit early.  Thank you!

I'm still furiously working on building out the website,
so I'm afraid there's not much I can do at this point other
than promise I'll keep you posted as things develop.  In the
meantime, if there's any questions I can answer please don't
hesitate to call/text my cell at 415.713.2126, or email me
at dbinetti@startnormal.com.


Thanks!
Dave
