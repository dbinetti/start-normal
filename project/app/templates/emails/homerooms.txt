I've been working as hard as I can to make the site more
useful to parents and recently finished some functionality
that I'd love you to try out.

I call it "Homerooms", and it's a way to create and manage
your own stable cohort of students.  Here's how it works:

On your dashboard you'll now see a link to the right of each student
called "Create Homeroom".  This will take you to a new screen
where you can enter a name, description and max size of your
desired Homeroom (ie, your stable cohort).  Your student automatically
becomes a member when you create a Homeroom.

Then, the page will generate a private link which you can use to
send out to other parents' children you'd like in your Homeroom.
If they accept, then they will also become part of the cohort.  Once
we get to five students total, I'll find a teacher for you
to start discussions on how and when to begin instruction.

Now I just built this functionality (literally, like ten minutes ago)
and while I tested it out as best I can, I know I've forgotten things.
That said, if you're willing to give it a try and perhaps even share the
link with a few parents that would put you at the top of the queue.
And if there is anything I've missed or is broken then I'll be
sure to fix it as fast as I can -- just let me know.

So that's Homerooms.  Please give it a try, or if there's any questions
I can answer please don't hesitate to call/text my cell at 415.713.2126,
or email me at dbinetti@startnormal.com.


Thanks!
Dave
