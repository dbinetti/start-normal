I've been working as hard as I can to make the site more
useful to parents and recently finished some functionality
that I'd love you to try out.

I call it "Homerooms", and a way to create and manage
your own stable cohort of students.  Here's how it works:

On your dashboard (https://www.startnormal.com/dashboard)
you'll now see a link to the right of each student
called "Create Homeroom".  This will take you to a new screen
where you can enter a name, description and max size of your
desired Homeroom (ie, stable cohort).  Your student automatically
becomes a member when you click.

The page will also generate a private link which you can use to
send out to other parents, asking their child to join that Homeroom.
If they accept, then they will also become part of the cohort.  Once
we get to five students total, I'll find a teacher for you
to start discussions on how and when to begin instruction.

Now I just built this functionality (literally, like ten minutes ago)
and while I tested it out as best I can, I know I've forgotten things.
That said, if you're willing to give it a try and perhaps even share the
link with a few parents that would put you first in line in the teacher
queue.  And if there is anything I've missed or is broken then I'll be
sure to fix it as fast as I can -- just let me know.

So that's Homerooms.  Please give it a try, or if there's any questions
I can answer please don't hesitate to call/text my cell at 415.713.2126,
or email me at dbinetti@startnormal.com.


Thanks!
Dave
