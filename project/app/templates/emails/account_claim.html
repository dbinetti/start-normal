This is an important one-time message; I'll keep it brief.

Here is your current signature:

    Signature Name:  {{signature.name}}
    Post this Signature on Website?  {{signature.is_public|yesno|title}}
    Location:  {{signature.get_location_display}}
    Notes: {{signature.notes|wordwrap:70|default:"(No notes submitted)"}}

If any of this incorrect, or you'd like to add some details
like your school district or desire to volunteer -- or you changed your mind
and would like to remove your signature -- then please click
the link below.  It will ask you to create a password and then
allow you to make changes.  The link expires in three days so you might
want to click it now while you're thinking about it:
{% block reset_link %}
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uid token %}
{% endblock %}
If you subscribed for updates you'll start receiving those through a
different service.  If you'd prefer not to receive updates there will be a
link at the bottom of each update which will make that one-click easy, and
if you'd like to start receiving them you can click here:

Finally, if you have any other questions, ideas, or just plain want to
talk, feel free to reply to this email or call me at 415.713.2126.

Thank you again for all you are doing to stand up for our kids!

Best, Dave
