4. Video #3 Student Spread https://start-normal.wistia.com/medias/fdhyfqu7kz
5. What’s next? An explainer on why starting normal is best



First, *thank you*.  It took forever, but I finally did get my
video on Student Spread finished.  That's at the bottom, but here are some updates:

**Signatures**
I was so pleased when we exceeded our original goal of 100 signatures and
stood at 400 signatures in my last update.  I was hoping to double
that total before Monday morning, but that didn't happen.  Instead, it *TRIPLED*.
Yes, we currently stand at just under 1,200 signatures -- an amazing jump given
it was a weekend.  Hitting four-digits is a big, big deal so well done and thank you!

**Meeting with Supervisor Slocum**
I'll be providing Supervisor Slocum with all our signatures in just a few hours, and
it's so great to be able to point to *thousands* of concerned parents.  I will
report on the results, probably in tomorrow's update.


**Adding Names/Initials**
I'll be adding names and initials to the website at some point today, which given your
preferences will appear as:

{% if signature.is_public %}
  {{signature.name}}
{% else %}
  Initials
{% endif %}

If you'd like to change this please let me know and I'll do so immediately.


**Video #3: Student Spread**
Here’s the latest video discussing Student Spread.  Please watch
and SHARE using the buttons on the bottom right of the video. It will take
some time to have everyone turn around, but we need to help ease the anxiety
any way we can.

**What's Next**
Up next is a quick overview of why starting normal is the best chance for our
school districts to survive.  Not sure I'll get it done today, but I'm going
to give it my level best.

As always, thank you for standing up for our children,

Dave
