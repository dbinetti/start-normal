This is an important administrative message.

Given the new guidance from the Public Health Officer, we've updated our letter and now use the petition language below.

I'm writing because you indicated you wanted your name to be public on the website, which it is currently (although not discoverable by search engines -- I've turned that off regardless.)  However, since the language has changed it's important you know the new language.

**Action Item**
If you agree with the new language, you need take no action.  However, if you disagree, I will change your affiliation to "private", or remove your affiliation entirely, or do whatever you wish.  Just reply to this email and I'll take immediate action accordingly.

Thank you again, Dave



- Begin Petition-
We must put our students and staff first.

The San Mateo Public Health Officer has called to modify the "Four Pillars" in light of child development needs; we support the following changes:

1. Removal of the Face Covering Pillar
  Masks work -- but only if worn properly and consistently.  At less than 80% adherence or efficacy masks are a false safety, and will come at great cost in instruction and social emotional impact to our children.

2. Adjustment of Physical Distance Pillar
  Adjusting to the World Health Organization distance guideline of 1-meter indoors-only has proved safe for tens of millions worldwide, and would allow for full-time instruction.

These reasonable modfications will allow for full-time instruction supporting our children's educational, mental, and social-emotional learning, in a safe and healthy environment.
