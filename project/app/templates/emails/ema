**Focus and Compassion**
I know the frustration has been rising for some time, and that for many of you
this effort broke the dam.  In some cases that means the School Boards or District
Superintendents are getting inundated with feedback, but I personally think they
are not the problem -- certainly not insofar as this issue goes.  They must implement
the health order, they have no choice.  Dr. Morrow is appointed by the San Mateo
County Board of Supervisors, and so that's where the attention needs to be directed
(hence my meeting with Warren.)

And when we do our outreach both to elected officials and others in our communities,
I would ask that we do so with tremendous compassion.  People are scared, and they
have reason to be.  I'm trying to use data to reduce the fear *mongering*,
particularly from those in leadership positions like Dr. Morrow, but the fear
itself is wholly legitimate and appropriate.

The balance remains the same:  the potentially lifelong impact to our kids' development
against the very real threat to teachers, staff and parents.  Yes, the more data we
get in the more we believe this is a false choice.  But we must acknowledge that
the risk will always be there, just like it is with every other endeavor in life.

Most of our frustration arose because rather that being listened to, we were
lectured to.  So let's just make sure we don't duplicate that unforced error.
I'd ask we be patient and kind when reaching out to our friends and neighbors --
and yes, even strangers on social media.

Thank you, I really appreciate it.


**Parents' Response Video**
And to that end, I've put together a video that does exactly that.  Yes, I know
I said the next one would be a "why normal" explainer, but I ended Video #3 with
a call for parents to send in case studies on child to adult transmission -- and
they did!  So I couldn't well ignore them while complaining we're being dismissed.

So please watch it and share it -- with compassion!
