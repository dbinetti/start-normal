First, *thank you*.  The response has been overwhelming and far exceeded even
my wildest hopes.  I have a new video that discusses Student Safety you can share,
but first some updates:

**Momentum**
Originally, I hoped we could get 100 signatures by the end of next week.
Well, we hit that in a few hours and now have more than 400 signatures.
And the breadth of support is county-wide: Atherton, Belmont, Burlingame,
East Palo Alto, Foster City, Half Moon Bay, Hillsborough, Menlo Park,
Millbrae, Pacifica, Portola Valley, Redwood City, San Carlos, San Mateo,
South San Francisco and Woodside.  Side Note: If you know anyone in Brisbane,
Daly City or San Bruno get them on board!  (Colma might be a stretch...)

**It is Working!**
My sources tell me the document is changing in our direction. However, key
components like masks and distance requirements remain in full force,
so we have a long way to go.  I have a meeting on Monday at 10AM with
Warren Slocum, who is the President of the San Mateo County Board of
Supervisors.  I'll print and deliver each letter directly to Supervisor
Slocum so that he knows where we all stand.

Our movement is barely 24 hours old and we've already made great progress.
But we need to keep up the pressure.  You've already signed the letter and that’s
wonderful.  But others need to hear that the policies pose a far greater risk
to our children than the disease itself.

**New Video to Share!**
To that end, here’s the latest video discussing Student Safety.  Please watch
and SHARE using the buttons on the bottom right of the video. The more sharing
this weekend, the more signatures for my Monday meeting with the Board of Supervisors.

**What's Next**
I have other videos planned.  Next will be a discussion on the risk of spread
and the safety of *teachers* (which frankly should be the focus of the framework
since they are the ones at any significant risk.)  But these do take time to
research thoroughly, so I don't want to rush them out too quickly.  Our greatest
strength is that the science is on our side, and that matters to me.

The School Safety data come directly from the CDC, so that's as good as it gets.
So please share it far and wide and keep the momentum going.


Many, many thanks,

Dave

P.S.  By the end of the day I’ll update the website with signatures (name and city).
This is powerful “social proof” that will get even more signatures.  I indicated
in the form that names and cities would be public but I wasn’t explicit about
the website, so just to be sure let me know if you’d like to switch to “Anonymous”
or be removed entirely and I'll do so immediately.
