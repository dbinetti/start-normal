Thank you again for being willing to serve as a Teacher in the Start Normal network.

I have a favor to ask: would you be willing to speak with me over the phone? Parents
continue to signup every day, and many of the groups are now ready to start
speaking with teachers such as yourself.  To make this the best possible experience
for you I'd like to know how you'd prefer these introductions to be made.

This would be a brief call.  Mostly I want to deeply understand your needs so I can
best serve you, the parents, and of course the children.  Feel free to respond via
email with a good time, or just call/text me directly at 415.713.2126,


Many, many thanks,
Dave
