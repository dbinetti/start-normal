UPDATE ON SIGNATURE LISTING

Apologies for the second intrusion, but I have heard from many who do not wish
their name listed listed on the website.

Accordingly, I'm switcing everyone to **Initials Only** on public-facing materials.

For instance, "DB, San Carlos"

If you wish something other than initials-only, including full name, or Anonymous,
or to be removed entirely, just let me know and I'll do it right away.  But effective
immediately, everyone is initials-only.

Sorry for the bother, Dave
