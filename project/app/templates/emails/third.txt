4. Next Steps


A short and sweet update:

**Supervisor Slocum Results**
My meeting with Supervisor Slocum was a good start.  He listened, understood our
concerns, and immediately tried to connect me with Dr. Morrow for a conversation.
I gave it 48 hours, but so far no response from Dr. Morrow or his office.  I'll
keep you posted if and when that conversation happens.

**SM Daily Journal Article**
This morning the San Mateo Daily Journal published an article titled
"Divergent opinions on school reopening plans in San Mateo County".  We were quoted
in it!  Sadly the SM Daily Journal has a paywall so isn't free, but the full article can be read here: https://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/local/divergent-opinions-on-school-reopening-plans-in-san-mateo-county/article_9c01206c-aad0-11ea-8677-0f03982bd7d8.html

**First Letter Delivered**
The first letter to the Board of Supervisors wound up at 1889 total.  That was a
fairly incredible result given we only had five days with which to work, and we
all should be proud of that result.  Our next letter will be to to Mike Callagy,
the San Mateo County Executive, and work has started on that already.  Which leads me to...

**What's Next**
It has been a whirlwind few days, and we're off to a tremendous start.  Now
it's time to catch our breath, enjoy the last few days of school, and give people
time to digest all this.  We'll take this time to do some much needed cleanup and
retooling, and will hitting the ground running twice as fast very soon.

Thank you all!

Dave
