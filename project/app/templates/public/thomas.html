      <h4>Transcript, Thomas Albeck Interview with David Binetti</h4>
    </div>
    <div class='card-body'>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Thank you. So I've started that now. Okay. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I'm so glad that Jacob was able to connect us because it's so hard to get quality information.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Yeah. Well, the news doesn't always reflect the reality, so I think it's always best to talk to people and just get as close to a sense of what's real as we can. So anyway, my goal here, my goal is to try to understand what's happening in the Dutch model. And just as practical as you can, and you can either tell us your-
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
When you say Dutch, you mean Danish, right?
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Pardon me. Pardon me.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
That's all right.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
You see my ignorance. The Danish model. Thank you.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
It's a common mistake, a common mistake.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
The Danish model.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah, yeah.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
So the Danish model and basically, two perspectives. One perspective is just as much as you're willing and comfortable, your personal experience. And then what you know from the broader community, like what are the challenges; what's happening; who's afraid; who's happy; is it fundamentally working or not? Anyway, so I'll just shut up now and let you talk.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah. Well, where should I start? I guess first point of view is, well, the place where we have had the most impact of the corona is with our children at the school where we had the most, what do you call it? Well, we were kind of scared in the beginning because this whole thing blew up. And when we had to restart the everyday life, they started with the schools. That was the first thing that opened. So of course, we were a bit, "How's this going to go?" Sent our kids on the frontline, you know. But everything went well.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
After the schools started, nothing happened worse than it was. Even all the virus, what you call it, the contamination, it still kept on going down so they started opening more things up, like the hairdressers. And suddenly, the bars opened with restrictions, of course. But I think the whole lockdown thing set the standard of how people were going to react to each other and all the discipline about washing hands and keeping distance. And that full lockdown kick started that.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
So I guess when we opened up again, people, they were scared, of course they were scared. A lot of young people were not scared enough, I guess, but still nothing bad happened. I think the standards were set because the politicians know some people can't be so, what do you say, can't be so strict with their way of behaving.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
I'm sorry. So you mean that the politicians-
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
They can't change... Yeah. I think they made really strict rules because they knew not everybody is going to be able to follow or are not going to follow these rules, so they had some kind of buffer.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Interesting. Let me actually take a step back because again, I'm only gleaning what I can of the Danish model from news reports. But my understanding is that there, and let me just say what I think and then you tell me if I'm right or wrong. You have increased health checks and hygiene, and I'm going to just focus directly on the schools. So increased health and hygiene, more frequent hand washing. A banning of larger gatherings like school assemblies or athletic events. There are no face covering requirements-
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
No.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
... in schools on either teachers, staff, or anybody at any age, correct?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
No, no. Yeah.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Okay. And the distancing requirements, do they follow the WHO guideline of one meter, or what are the distance... Because I've seen that they're-
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah. They started with two meters, and then they followed the WHO guidelines, I think. So it's down to one now.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
I see. I understand they're also allowed to break the distance if required, like if a kid falls down and bumps their knee, the teachers can console them and things of that nature.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yes. One of the important headlines was well, in the beginning it was quite strict and people started, what you call it, well, they started discussing this because it's children and how are children going to behave. And is it their responsibility to keep the distance? Then it was said loud from the politicians. They said, "Children have to be children. If we put them in groups, then it has to be groups where they can play, they can interact. They can play tag." Of course, they have to keep all the hygienic issues, but again, it's the adults, it's the teachers who has to remind them. It's not the children's responsibility, and that was said out loud.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
That made a lot of comfort in the whole society, I think, because none of us wanted to put this responsibility over to our children because they can't handle this responsibility. Because they are children, and they're going to play and they're going to not think. We have to think for them sometimes. That's why we're adults. They started with small groups so we could see how it developed. They started at five or six, seven children together in a classroom with the two meters distance. Then when it went down to one, they halved the groups, so now it's 10, 10 children together. But when it's recess, they still meet in the schoolyard and play together.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
All the students?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah. Yeah, more or less. Some of the older students have another schedule. I can't quite remember how their school day is, but the smaller children, they have shorter school days and things like that. Once they're outside, it's more or less all right just to be together.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
I understand. There's one thing I wanted to just focus on directly. So you're saying actually that your public leaders, they took the lead on this. So your public leaders actually came out and helped pull the public along as opposed to it didn't come from the public. The public officials said, hey, we have to let kids be kids, and they were the ones who tried to relax people and put them more at ease.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah. Well, it had to be said because they had to make some sort of, well, not damage control but some sort of control so that the parents would send their children to school. Because there was a lot of discussions back and forth of putting the children in the frontline, and then the politicians together with all the health experts came out with this statement. I don't know if they knew. We can only guess, but they had to make this statement to reassure that everything, it was not the children's responsibility because that was the main issue.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Got it, got it. That's very helpful. Now, when people came back, was this a requirement? I don't know the Danish laws, so are they required to attend school or did they have the ability to wait? So there's two questions. What I'm really driving at is how many people started off? Was it everybody or was it 10% and then it grew to 50%? Or has that changed? More people have left than have come? How has attendance and enrollment worked
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
In the school?
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Yes, in schools. I'm only talking about schools.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah, in school. Yep. Well, in the beginning it was only first till fifth grade, I think.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Okay.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Fourth or fifth grade to start with because the idea was that the older children from sixth grade and up, they interact more after school. And the younger children, it's easier for the parents to contain them at home. Because in the beginning it was like you go to school and you go home, and maybe you have two or three friends, the same friends, that you see. It wasn't rolled out that you could see everybody in the school. So they started with the kindergarten up to fourth grade or fifth grade. I can't remember.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
I understand.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
When they saw this went well, they opened up after a month, I think. Don't hang me up on that, but after a while they opened up for sixth and up till 10th grade.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Now, this has been in place since April, correct?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah. I think it was 22nd of April we started up.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
And have you seen any evidence of widespread outbreaks or teacher infections or anything of that nature?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
No. Not in the school. There was one incident in high school, but not in public school.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Got it. Putting aside just the grades, let's say you have just an average first grade, maybe your own, whatever grade your children were in. When they first started up, was it half of normal attendance? Did half of the parents keep their kids home even though the school was open or did all of the parents send them in? And what were the requirements? Were they required to bring their children in? I don't know what the Danish law is.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Well, you have to go to school. That's the Danish law. So if you don't go to school, you have to make a statement and say, I'm doing homeschooling. But in the first official statement was if you don't send your children to school, well, we have this child support, some kind of support when the children are young, get from the state every three quarters. They would take some of that money back if you didn't send the children to school, if you didn't say, I'm doing homeschool.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
This statement they took back and said, "It's all right. It's all right if you're not comfortable in the beginning," but they wanted to reassure everything's all right. We did the math. We can do this if we keep... Long story short, in the beginning people hesitated, but still a lot went to school because it was only groups of six, seven children.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
And when you say a lot, do you have sort of a rough idea? I mean-
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Well, in the class where my daughter went, the first three days, it was a short week, I think only half. But already on Monday when it started up the first week, more parents were reassured that okay, this is going to work. We think this is going to work. So I think that was already up to 100% of that class almost. Where we see a difference was when they had the time after school. We had this, I don't know if you have it in the States, but when the school finishes, there's a place where you can hang out with your friends. Because if the school finishes at 2:00, maybe you just get picked up at 4:00. So in the meantime, you can stay there in the school with adults. I don't know what it's called.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Yeah. We call it aftercare. Typically, it's called aftercare.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah, yeah. Aftercare. So that's where a lot stayed away from because this was more a free space and a lot of cross-contamination issues where people were worried. So everybody got picked up from school more or less at 12:00 when school finished.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Got it. That sounds right. Has aftercare returned to its original attendance or is aftercare still sort of parents are wary of aftercare?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
No. It's getting up to speed, but we can see in the daily... Well, a lot of people still have some shifting work times, so they work more at home some days. So the kids can get picked up earlier. It's still not as it was before, but there's no concerns about it.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
How have the teachers responded? Have the teachers embraced this or they had trepidation? How have the teachers responded?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Well, in the media we haven't heard anything from the teachers. Myself, I'm actually a teacher at another school, a special school for kids with special needs. But a the public school there wasn't any, well, not public anyway, concerns. They had time to get everything sorted out and didn't have to open up before they were ready. So they had to get all the structural things going with enough sinks to wash hands and everything had to be structured in a new way. So they didn't open up before this was ready, and when they did, when we talked to the teachers, they seemed quite cool about it and relaxed.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Did you have any teacher drop off or were the full complement of teachers there?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
No. It was the same. Actually, they hired more people.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Oh, interesting. What about older teachers or teachers that may have had diabetes or some other advanced conditions? Were they also in the schools or did they retire?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
No, no. It was also a longer story because in the beginning it was not clear who had to go to work and who could stay home. At the end they ended up saying, "Talk to your doctor. If your doctor is concerned or if you are concerned because of some health issues, you have to contact your doctor and together with this medical expert, they have to take a decision." But the workplaces I've heard of in schools, there's an understanding generally. If you're concerned of anything either at home or if you have some sickness in the family so it's extra vulnerable, there is a general understanding that well, it's okay if you're not thrown in from the first moment. That's society... Oh, I can't find the English word for it.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
No, that's okay. Don't worry about it. I'm understanding what you're saying. When these were put into place, was there a sort of schedule that said like, here's how we're going to relax restrictions? Or did they simply say, look, we're going back to school. We're going to do some minor changes on health and hygiene and gatherings and some two meter distance, but otherwise we're going to try to function normally and then people just sort of naturally came back as slowly. And they naturally as they became more comfortable expanded to fill the gaps? Or did they say, here are the restrictions and then this is our schedule for relaxing restrictions over time? Which way did it go?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
In the beginning, they just said, "This is the restrictions." Then we had some dates where we would get new information. I think it was after a month the first time, or I think it was maybe two weeks. They had very specific dates where they said, "Well, we start up now. This is the restrictions. After two weeks we will look at it again, see if the infections is rising, the numbers, or if it's lowering or if it's the status quo." So we were guided to the next step, so to say. I don't know if that answers your question.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Yeah, that largely answers my question, but can you tell me what some of those restrictions were, or was it merely that it went from two meter to one meter? The reason I'm asking is because if there was only... Well, anyway, nevermind. Do you happen to recall back in April what the initial restrictions were and then how they fell off?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah. In the beginning, it was yeah, as you know, two meters and you could only play with the children in the classroom or from the classroom. From the classroom.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
We're calling that a cohort, so yes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah. You had to in public not be more than 10 people. That was the limit. 10 people gathering was the most and that's also why they had this in school. Of course, the hand wash really scheduled. When you get to school, after you've been in the classroom, before you go out, when you get in, so quite strict there. Also, play dates, after school they wanted to keep this to a minimal level. And after this one meter, when the restrictions fell to one meter, it opened up for more, of course, socializing the children between and more play dates.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
But the most important thing that they've been repeating again and again, this is the one meter distance and the hygienics, to the hand wash and cough in your elbow, in your sleeve. This is the three things that are repeated again and again and again, even in the media, in the radio, in the train stations, everywhere.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Okay. So those three things are one meter distance, cough in your elbow, and what was the third?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
And wash your hands regularly.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Wash your hands regularly. Got it.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
You said they could play tag. Does that just simply mean that they don't want people to be too close for long periods of time, but they're not-
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Go ahead.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Well, in the schools it's again this thing about children have to be children. So you have this general three rules when you walk around in everyday life, when you stand in the supermarkets, wherever you walk. But in the school, it's when you sit in the classroom, it's the one meter distance because you're inside. When you're outside, we were told that the virus is not so effective. It doesn't spread so easily when you're outside. So when there's recess, they get to play along with each other without keeping this one meter distance because that's impossible for the children.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Yes. Yes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
You know. So the most important thing that we're told is now it's up to 100 people that can meet, and in a couple of weeks it will be 200. The thing is that they keep on repeating, as long as we are aware of the distance, not hugging, not giving handshakes, not kissing people on the cheek, keeping the distance, washing your hands, and sneezing in the elbow, coughing in the elbow, then a lot of things will work out. That's the tactic right now, I think.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
So in general, now I'm going to move beyond the schools, but in general you're saying there's no mask requirements then in Denmark?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
No. The most restrictive thing is the borders really because inside Denmark's borders, well, that's the main three things. People have been fined for being more than 10 people together but not very much. It's more sort of a statement that we mean this seriously and there's no reason to keep people away from each other more because well, there's new habits. People take it seriously.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
This is great.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Let me get back to the schools for a second. How do they eat lunch? How do they go to the bathroom? Because we've been contemplating some fairly restrictive approaches to that, but does that function normally or are there different rules for eating in cafeterias?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah. Some schools have some sort of lunch agreement with food from outside that you can buy, and that's not been up and running. So everybody had to bring a lunch from home, but in Denmark it's pretty normal to have lunchbox from home. It's not many schools where you can buy lunch.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Do the students eat by themselves, or do they eat in the cafeteria context? Or do they eat outside? How do they actually-
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
No. As we do every day normally, it's in the classrooms.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
I see, okay. So that's-
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
That's the normal thing. We don't have the... I actually don't know if the bigger classes have some sort of area, but at the moment it's in the classrooms where they eat with the teachers.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Okay. I want to touch down on the initial restrictions because you said it started at two meters, which is quite challenging, well, at least in our experience, because most of the classrooms are relatively small. One of the problems that we're having is that you can't fit the required number of students. We're having to consider split schedules because we can't fit all the students in the same class with the distance requirements. So how did that work initially and how does it work now?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Well, I guess that's one of the reasons why they also started with first to fifth grade because then you had a lot of empty classrooms where you can divide the children up.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Got it.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah. Because half of the school almost was still at home, so they had double the number of classrooms of normal.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
So it just worked out naturally?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah. That helped a lot in the school where my daughter goes, but I know there's been issues in other schools where they had to... Well, luckily we had a perfect spring with a lot of sun, so people were outside with small tents and had classrooms outside. In the beginning, a lot of the class activity was outside.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Got it, got it.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
But yeah, if the whole school would start up at once, it wouldn't have been possible to do that, I guess, because you wouldn't have enough-
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
The natural people that were a little bit apprehensive sort of gave you the space and you didn't have to move to split schedules, I guess is what I'm saying.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Well, it was sort of a split schedule because half of the school wasn't there.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Okay, yes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Because you know, sixth to tenth grade, they were at home. They weren't allowed to go to school in the beginning.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
That's such an easy solution. Anyway, I won't comment. Okay. That sounds great. When they're at home, did you start providing a distance learning, a virtual, remote online instruction? Is that still available today? If you could say how many people have elected to remain home now after whatever it is, three months, four months... Let me ask one question at a time. Do you provide a distance learning option and is that still available?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
I don't know if I quite understand that question. If it's possible for you to get... Oh, distance learning. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's possible if you are in quarantine because of virus in the family. Or if there is any reason to be afraid that there's a virus in the family inside the four walls, then you can stay home and you can get distance learning. A teacher will contact you. But it's not a fixed setup.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Interesting. So then it's not really made available. The expectation is that you are going to do in-person instruction unless there is a compelling reason not to?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yep.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Okay. Very good. That still takes place then, but what I'm hearing is that it's more ad hoc.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
I haven't heard of it, but that was what we were told in the beginning, "If you have to stay home, it's still possible and we will contact you. And we will give you the homework and then give you help with the class schedule."
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Okay, wonderful. What were the rules? Did they say rules, if we have an outbreak... Well, let me ask another question. Do they do testing, contact testing or tracing? Do they do swab testing or is it just they just take temperatures or maybe not even take temperatures; they just go to school?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
No, no. Not at school, but you're told to stay home if you're sick. If you cough, you're not allowed to come to school until you are tested. There is a big, big test. Well, it's possible to test a lot of people every day and it's not being used. At the moment there's a lot of facilities just standing by. I had my son checked because he couldn't go to kindergarten because he coughed, so we just went online and booked a time for getting him swabbed. Then two days after no corona, we could send him off again. That's how it works. If you have any concerns, you can just book a... You don't have to go through your doctor anymore because the capacity is so big. So you can just book online or call and then schedule an appointment.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Yeah. We've got the excess capacity here too, so that sounds reasonable. That's super. You said that there was one high school that had an outbreak. Were the rules... and did they immediately close the schools, or how did they respond to the outbreak and how bad was it?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Well, it was quite a silly story because it's typical Danish. There was these young people. We can still go to Sweden. The borders are not closed, but we are told that if you go to Sweden, you have to stay in quarantine for 14 days. It's not the law enforcement who will say you have to stay home, but it's advised. These children went to Melmuri in Sweden just over by the bridge and they went out in the city because Sweden haven't locked down anything.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Right.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
So they went over there and they came home. Of course, we don't know if they were infected in Sweden.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Right. But that, of course. You might as well blame the Swedes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah, yeah. But they went to their high school the Monday afterwards and it resulted in... Because one of them had corona afterwards, and it resulted in the whole first year of high school, they were sent home.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Great. Did they get sick, or they were just sent home precautionarily?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Only one or I don't know how many from that group was tested positive, but they just get sent home for precautions.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Got it.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Because it takes, what do you say, 12 to 14 days before... It can take up to 12 to 14 days. So once you've been in contact with somebody who has the infection or the virus, then you get sent home for 14 days.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Yeah, okay. Great. I'm assuming nobody was hurt and the children recovered.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
No. No, no, no.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Yeah, okay. Okay. I have taken up so much of your time and I want to be respectful of that. Do you have any questions for me? Is there any way that I can help you in any way?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
No. I was just interested in what's the situation right now. I just heard a small bit from Jacob. The school is completely in lockdown and everything is on lockdown too after summer or?
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Well, yeah. So here's the situation. The schools closed on March 23rd, I want to say, and then they told us it would be two weeks. They continued to get pushback and then after a while and about, I don't know, late April, they finally said, "We're not going to return to school this year." Everyone just dealt with it and we figured out how we were going to rearrange and so forth. They came through and they also closed all summer camps and all summer activities. So our last day of instruction was actually yesterday. Pardon me. Now everybody is... well, they've been figuring it out for a while, but we're all trying to figure out exactly what kids are going to do.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
In the actual real world, life is returning very much back to normal, at least as far as kids are concerned. You can go to the parks and nobody's wearing masks. Everyone's playing together. Our experience has been very similar to everybody else's experience, which is that the nursing homes have been severely hit.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yes. Same here.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Here in our county two-thirds of the deaths have happened in the nursing homes. 67% are over the age of 80. Almost 40% are over the age of 90, so it's very heavily skewed towards the very old and the very sick. I mean every death is terrible, but it's been 93 deaths out of a county of 700,000. Anyway. They're slowly starting to do things like allow restaurants to open outdoors and so forth, but the school plan has just come out and it's crushingly restrictive. The normal things that you talked about, preventing large gatherings above 10 and frequent hand washing, we go a little bit further.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
We do testing and temperature checks. But all those things, well, they're proposed. We don't know yet. They're proposed, but then there's two other major requirements, which are face coverings and distance. The masks are required for all students, all staff, all visitors and all teachers, and it starts at kindergarten through age 22 indoors and out at all times.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
That's wow.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Yeah. It's pretty crazy.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
That's crazy.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
So people are having a visceral reaction to that. Then the second is the distancing requirements, which here is based on the CDC guidelines, which are six feet. That means that we're moving towards what are called hybrid instruction models, and the hybrid instruction model simply means that the students are on campus half the time and the other half of the time they're at home distance learning. And that's true for the entire student body. But the problem is they don't exactly know how they're going to have teachers do both distance and in person. Because actually, our budgets are being cut, so we're having to let go teachers.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
We can't hire new teachers, and it's not obvious how we can have teachers do two jobs while we're cutting staff. That's also causing a lot of consternation. And of course, particularly in our area, we have a lot of working parent families and people are just asking, if my kid's home half the time, how do I go back to work? And even if I'm working from home, how do I manage an eight-year-old trying to work from home? Some parents are trying to take extended leave of absence from their jobs and it's a mess.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
The problem is, at least here, and it's so striking the way you described it because here and generally speaking, but particularly in our county, we have a public health officer that is really intent on hyping the fear. His last letter on June the 1st said, "We're going to be relaxing the restrictions, but things could explode at any moment. And any person you meet could have the virus, and there's fear of mass death." Literally, used the term mass death when we've had 90 people die in the nursing homes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
That put people really on edge and so that's, I think, the piece that's most striking is that your Danish public officials appear to have taken a different tack where they're trying to sort of look at the data and calm and reassure the public. And here they're hiding the data. They're not telling us anything, and they're just saying, "You've got to do this or thousands of people will die, including your children." It's very disconcerting.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
That's scary.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Oh, yeah. People are terrified, absolutely terrified. And those of us who are trying to say, "Hey, wait a minute. I know we were all scared back in March because we didn't know anything, but now we know a whole bunch more and maybe we should look at this data that say that kids don't get sick and it doesn't even look like they spread it. Why don't we go look at the Danish model where people are not dropping like flies even though they're just making smart choices." But those of us who raise that topic, you wouldn't believe how much people have come after us. Jacob probably told you, but I just started this little effort to try to, at least in my mind, bring a little sanity to all this and, oh my gosh, the attacks have been incredible. It's like, I don't understand.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Well, if people are scared, of course they would react. Because I was terrified in the beginning, and I was like, "Ah man, this is never going to work. How are we going to do this?" I live in Copenhagen, so many people. There were so many things that I was scared of. But when we started up again, you had new routines. And of course, you think a lot of how you act when you're out in the public and keep distance and everything, but now it's actually, it's okay again.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
I think if you wear the masks, that's just my opinion, because it was a big discussion in Denmark because I think it was the WHO who recommended the use of the masks. But the Danish government didn't want to go that way, and the health specialists and everything said, "It's a false safety for people who don't know how to use it." It's required of course when you work in the hospital. It's required if you work with other people as a professional, but for children, for adults, just like gloves, it's a false safety because you forget that you have to take care of the people around you if you wear a mask.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
You forget to cough in the elbow and all the routines, and you will contaminate the mask if you put it down and then put it up again and put it down. So in their opinion, and I think that too, if you're not a professional and use it as it should, you shouldn't use it at all because then it just makes it worse.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
And that was the determination of the government and they made that pretty clear from the start?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah, yeah.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Also, I'm used to working with children and watching them develop through all the facial expressions. If you wear a mask, you can't, what you call it, you can't see what the other person's mean. One thing is the spoken word, but when you're a small kid, you have to look at the expressions. If you're covered up, you can't. You can't see that and people get scared. I had my son to, as I told you, this corona test, and he was scared shitless. Pardon my French.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
That's okay.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
He was so scared of this person standing here all covered up with face mask, goggles and everything. He just froze. So if the teachers, if all the children, if everybody has to wear masks, it will just scare more than it will do good, I guess. But that's just my opinion.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Sure, I understand. Well, there are many people that share that opinion.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
But is there any scientific...
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Oh. Well, yeah. Masks work. There's no question masks work, but as you've indicated, there's two things they have to do. First of all, there's adherence, so you have to actually be wearing it. Then two, there's efficacy, which means it has to be of the proper quality and fitted properly. There's this wonderful little scatter chart that I'll send you afterwards that shows you that you need 80% adherence on both axes. It needs to be 80% effective and worn 80% of the time. And if you don't do both of those, then the effectiveness just drops like a stone.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Again, masks work, but only if they're done properly. And if they're not done properly, then it is a false sense of security, as you've identified. That's why I think your officials made that choice because they looked at that and said, "Hmm." So you either have to do rigorous enforcement, and this is one of the things that the teachers are asking. They're asking a question like, okay, well, if my student isn't wearing... I can barely keep them from chewing gum. If they don't wear a mask, do I give them detention? Do I send them to the office? What do I do? They don't have an answer, of course.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
What we've seen in other places where they do have the mask requirements, that's one of the very first things to go. They just are like, "This is just never going to work." So the long-term social-emotional ramifications haven't happened because everybody says, "This is stupid," and they just take them off. It's like there's just no point in trying to keep them on kindergartners.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
No.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
That's just silly.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah. Because you can't-
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
So why even bother putting the restriction because there's no planet on which this works.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
No. And you can't say, "Well, if you don't wear it, you die." That's what they want you to think, maybe. You can't control it. It's children and it's young people, and they're not going to wear those masks. They have to have some other things that they can do about not getting infected.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, that sounds about right. Anyway, the distance requirements are very practical, and the mask requirements we've already gone over at length. That's really where most of our attention is focused because we're calling this start normal because we just want people to, as much as possible, want the schools to be normal. To us, the hygiene and the prohibitance of gatherings makes good sense because those are still fundamentally normal. But the masks and the distance are considerably less than normal and in some cases it's like, this is just simply... it's just not going to work.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
For us, what's happening is the districts are all eventually going to decide to move towards a full-time 100% distance learning model, which they're saying will be required until a vaccine is developed. So parents are now starting to contemplate several years of their kids at home full time with online instruction, and they're understandably very apprehensive about that. The way that I see it, pretty simply, is that fundamentally we don't have a choice. We can't do distance learning for years. We can't have our children home for the next three to four years.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
No.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
So eventually, you cannot fit all those students in the school with a two-foot distance requirement. This is all going to end the same way. It's going to end with all the kids in class not wearing masks and having mostly a normal experience. So if that's going to happen eventually because it has to happen, we might as well start that way. That's fundamentally what we're saying.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
I think it's a good point to start out slow because then you can reassure, this is all right. This is the way to do it. I think it's-
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Your experience was that that just happened naturally, right?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Exactly.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
I mean that just happened because people were apprehensive. Yeah. Okay, great. Well, I don't know that I have enough in my repertoire to give to you. Because this has been so helpful and so refreshing and so reassuring and so insightful, I don't have the words to express my gratitude for you taking the time to-
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Oh, no problem.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
... let me know what's happening in Denmark. I know that I said I wouldn't, and I won't, share this, but with your permission, what I'd like to do is I'd like to make a transcript of this and send it to you. And if you are willing, I think other parents here need to hear your experience because they are terrified right now, terrified. Our public officials are just stoking that fear. I'm happy to just anonymize your name, but Thomas, I really think that you would make so many people feel so much better if they were able to hear your voice and hear your experience. So I will respect and honor the fact that that was not why I set this up. I set this up to take notes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah, yeah.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
But as I went through it, I'm like, "Oh my god, if people heard this, oh my god, their lives would be so much better." Is that acceptable?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
I would be glad to help because well, if I was in your situation, I don't know what I would do when I can see how it can be. So of course, if you make a transcript, you can send it.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Great.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
That's why Jacob thought of me. When we started school back in April, there was a German television who went and made some small interview video just for the news in Germany. They filmed up in the classroom and they filmed just around the school. If it would be nice to just... Sometimes the visual part can reassure people more than the spoken word.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
And that would be spectacular. If you actually have a link or otherwise know what I would look for, that would...
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yeah. I have the video myself.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
If you could send that to me, that would be spectacular.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
And of course, it's in German, but-
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
No. We'll find somebody to translate it. Don't worry. I can solve that problem.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Because they had some follow ups because of them starting up the week after us, so there is some video from the school and where the teacher and the principal is interviewed. And myself and my daughter [inaudible 00:53:24]. I could send you that.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Please, please. Please, please, please. That would be spectacular. This is great. This is beyond amazing. Again, if I didn't have a distance requirement, I'd kiss you. My lord, this has been so amazing. Well, listen, it has been an hour.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yep, it's all right.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Thank you so much and I'll send you the transcript as soon as it's done. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Yep. You're welcome.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Okay. Bye now. Yes. Go ahead, please.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Talk to you soon. Talk to you again. I can just send you those clips, and you're more than welcome to write or call if you need some more on this subject because-
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Well, I might. I might, but for now I'm just going to concentrate on this because even this hour has been enlightening beyond all measure. So I'm going to start here and then we'll take things from there.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
All right. Perfect.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Thank you, Thomas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Well, yeah. You're welcome. Talk to you again soon, maybe.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Hopefully. Cheers.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas:</strong><br>
Okay, cheers. Bye.
</p>

<p>
<strong>David:</strong><br>
Bye.
</p>
